I’ve also gained industry experience during my internship at Momenta, where I applied deep learning algorithms to predict optimal vehicle paths using multimodal data. Currently, I’m working as a grader for the University of Chicago, evaluating Python algorithm design assignments for a Master’s course.

# Internship Experience
### Momenta (Hangzhou City, China)  
**Deep Learning Algorithms Engineer Intern** | *Jan. 2024 – May 2024*  
- Processed multimodal vehicle perception data using deep learning.  
- Improved the stability of model trajectory output in scenarios such as intersection U-turns and automatic mode switching using C++ for output processing .
- Use Python to mine low-performance scene data on the cluster and fine-tune the model to improve performance on 80% of the mined data while maintaining benchmark results on the original data.

### University of Chicago  
**MPCS Grader** | *Sept. 2024 – Present*  
- Course: MPCS 55001 Algorithm, MPCS 55005 Advanced Algorithms
- Graded Python algorithm design assignments for Master of Computer Science students.
